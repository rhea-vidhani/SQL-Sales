SQL Sales & Operational Analysis Project

Recently completed a SQL-driven analysis of 100 sales transactions to uncover what truly drives revenue — and what silently blocks it.

Key insights uncovered:
• 55% of revenue concentrated among just 4 repeat customers
• Revenue growth driven by bulk, high-ticket purchases, not order volume
• Delhi & Mumbai contribute 52% of total demand
• Despite strong demand, 71% of orders fail to realize revenue due to operational inefficiencies
• High-value orders are most at risk — not due to demand, but execution

Strategic focus areas identified:
Customer retention > acquisition
Product bundling > discounting
City-specific fulfillment > uniform national strategy

This project reinforced how SQL is not just a querying tool, but a decision-making engine when paired with the right business lens.

Tools: SQL | Aggregations | Segmentation | Business Insight
